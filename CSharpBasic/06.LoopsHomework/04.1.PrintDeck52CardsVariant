//Problem 4.	Print a Deck of 52 Cards
//Write a program that generates and prints all possible cards from a standard deck of 52 cards (without the jokers). The cards should be printed using the classical notation (like 5♠, A♥, 9♣ and K♦). The card faces should start from 2 to A. Print each card face in its four possible suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades.

//This is variant with arrays
using System;

class PrintDeck52CardsVariant
{
    static void Main()
    {
        //Arrays
        string[] cards = { "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K", "A" };
        int[] colors = { 3, 4, 5, 6 };

        foreach (var card in cards)
        {
            foreach (var color in colors)
            {
                Console.Write(card);
                Console.Write((char)color + " ");
            }
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
    }
}
